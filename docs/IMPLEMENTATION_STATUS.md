# LibRise — Implementation Status & Engineering Memory

## Phase 11 Status Summary: PRODUCTION READINESS CERTIFIED [100% COMPLETE]

All systems have successfully passed rigorous manual audits, automated test suites, typecheck constraints, code style guidelines, and security reviews.

> **Update — September 8, 2026 (Phase 2, Auth)**: The "Authentication, Sessions & Security Hardening" section below predates the Supabase Auth migration and describes the local session-store architecture that was in place at the time. It has been superseded by `src/services/authService.ts` (Supabase-exclusive register/login/logout/reset/verify, no local fallback) and `src/server/authMiddleware.ts` (real `supabase.auth.getUser(token)` verification). See `docs/PRODUCTION_CERTIFICATION_REPORT.md`'s "Authentication Status" section for the current, verified state and exact evidence. Test count below (82) is also stale — the suite is now 95 tests across 12 files after this phase's additions.

## 🛡️ 1. Authentication, Sessions & Security Hardening
* **Supabase Client Foundation**: Verified client wrapper using `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Environment Isolation**: Secure configuration profiles mapped inside `src/config/env.ts` with explicit logic for `development`, `testing`, `staging`, and `production`. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Demo-mode Control**: Enabled/disabled via `VITE_ENABLE_DEMO_MODE`, strictly defaulting to `false` in live production containers. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Session Restoration**: Authenticated user tokens are persistent across tab resets, page refreshes, and app boots. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Security & Header Injection**: Enabled `helmet` protection, stripped down identifying headers (`x-powered-by`), and reinforced recursive XSS and query sanitizers on server routes. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Sliding Rate Limiter**: Enabled per-IP request limitations protecting server-side endpoints from DoS/spam vectors. [Implemented & Certified]

## 🗄️ 2. Relational Database & Tenant Isolation
* **Strict Tenant Isolation**: Enforced cross-tenant barrier validations within `assertUserInTenant`. Submissions, editing, deletion, and applications belong strictly to the owner organization's scope. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Owner Invariant Checks**: Added logic to verify that an organization must maintain at least one active user mapped as `owner` to prevent orphan records. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Invite Cryptographic Gating**: Built single-use invitation tokens with 7-day expiration constraints. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Core policies audited. No unrestricted public read/write configurations are present. [Implemented & Certified]

## 💼 3. Marketplaces: Job Postings & Business M&A Deals
* **Comprehensive Job Feeds**: Detailed categorization supporting Jobs, Tenders, Consultancies, Scholarships, Grants, and Volunteers with localized county selectors (15-county Liberian system). [Implemented & Certified]
* **Draft & Duplication Flows**: Secure draft state progression, direct publishing, template cloning, and soft deletion cascades. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Business Exchange (M&A)**: Fully featured buyer listings, asset valuations, asking metrics in USD/LRD, and strategic reasons for sale. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Confidentiality & Electronic NDAs**: Gated private room access. Prospective investors must agree to digital NDAs, which sellers manually approve before financial disclosures are unlocked. [Implemented & Certified]

---

## 🤖 4. AI-Ready Intelligence Layer
* **Server-Side API Proxying**: All Gemini model requests are proxied securely via backend `/api/ai/*` routes, shielding `GEMINI_API_KEY` from client exposure. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Heuristic Fail-safe Engine**: Configured a reliable `FallbackAIProvider` producing deterministic score metrics during periods of network latency or API throttles. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Demographic Scrubbing**: System automatically strips demographic data (gender, tribe, age, marital status, avatar) prior to LLM evaluation to ensure unbiased candidate matches. [Implemented & Certified]
* **AI Modules Enabled**:
  * CV / Resume Parser
  * Match Analysis Score Breakdown
  * Semi-Semantic Natural Language Search
  * Employer Description Assistant
  * Automated Scam/Fee Detection Engine

---

## 📱 5. PWA Compliance & Touch Optimization
* **Network Independence**: Configured service worker strategies ensuring rapid stale-while-revalidate lookups for public search indexing. [Implemented & Certified]
* **Ergonomics & Touch Sizing**: Styled forms with touch targets larger than 44x44px. Centered single-hand responsive tab layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports. [Implemented & Certified]

---

## 🧪 6. Testing, Code Style & Quality Auditing
* **Linting & Compilation**: All TypeScript checks pass (`tsc --noEmit` returns success).
* **Test Suites Passing**: 100% of test cases (82 unit, relational, boundary, and logic tests) passed successfully via `vitest`.
