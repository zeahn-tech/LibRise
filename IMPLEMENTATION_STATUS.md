## 1. Core Job Marketplace Implementation

### 1.1 Job & Opportunity Creation & Drafts
- **Draft Creation**: Employers, institutions, and asset sellers can create listings in `draft` mode without publishing them to the public feed.
- **Direct Publishing**: Opportunities and business listings can be published directly, broadcasting across all 15 Liberian counties.
- **Reusable Opportunity Architecture**:
  - Expanded opportunity types beyond standard jobs: `job`, `tender`, `consultancy`, `internship`, `scholarship`, `fellowship`, `training`, `grant`, `contract`, `volunteer`, `partnership`, `investment`.
  - Shared lifecycle, application engine, screening questions, and search/filter infrastructure.
  - Employment Type (`full_time`, `part_time`, `contract`, `internship`, `temporary`, `volunteer`).
  - Workplace Model (`on_site`, `hybrid`, `remote`).
  - 15 Liberian Counties selection with localized city/district precision.
  - Compensation & Funding: Currency selector (USD / LRD), Salary/Valuation Min/Max, negotiable toggle, and confidential toggle.
  - Vacancy openings count, application deadlines, summary, structured responsibilities, requirements, and skill tags.
  - Screening Questions engine for upfront candidate qualification.

### 1.2 Job Editing & Duplication
- **In-Place Editing**: Authorized employers can update existing vacancies (salary ranges, requirements, deadlines, workplace models, and responsibilities).
- **Template Duplication**: Quick 1-click duplication of previous postings as new drafts with randomized unique slug keys and fresh 30-day deadlines.

### 1.3 Lifecycle State Machine
- **Draft** (`draft`): Visible only in the author organization's Job Management Dashboard.
- **Published** (`published`): Live on the public feed and search engine; accepting applications.
- **Closed** (`closed`): Live postings manually withdrawn from accepting candidates.
- **Expired** (`expired`): Automatically identified and transitioned when the deadline date is in the past.
- **State Transitions Supported**:
  - `Draft -> Published` (1-click publish)
  - `Published -> Draft` (Unpublish)
  - `Published -> Closed` (Close position)
  - `* -> Expired` (Deterministic deadline evaluation & automated cron sweep)
  - `* -> Deleted` (Permanent soft-purge with cascading audit trail)

### 1.4 Job Detail & Public Feed
- **Job Detail Modal**: Rich view including compensation breakdown (dual currency with real-time USD/LRD rate conversion), verified organization badge, county location, screening questions, and direct candidate application flow.
- **Employer Controls**: Context-aware owner action bar (Edit Vacancy, Close, Unpublish, Delete) available exclusively to authorized organization members or platform administrators.

### 1.5 Multi-Parameter Search & Filtering
- **Keyword Search**: Substring match against job title, organization name, county, district, summary, description, and skill tags.
- **County Filter**: Filter by any of Liberia's 15 counties (`Montserrado`, `Nimba`, `Bong`, `Grand Bassa`, `Margibi`, `Maryland`, `Lofa`, etc.).
- **Opportunity Category**: Filter across Jobs, Public Tenders, Consultancies, Internships, and Grants.
- **Employment Type**: Filter by Full-Time, Contract, Internship, Part-Time, Temporary.
- **Workplace Model**: Filter by On-Site, Hybrid, and Remote.
- **Minimum Salary Threshold**: Real-time numeric compensation filtering.
- **One-Click Reset**: Instant clearance of active filters.

### 1.6 Job Management Dashboard
- **Centralized Employer Control**: Dedicated management view within the Recruiter Workspace.
- **Status Tab Filtering**: `All`, `Published`, `Draft`, `Expired`, and `Closed` tabs with dynamic counts.
- **Metric Cards**: Real-time counter of total vacancies, active published listings, drafts in progress, and total applications received.
- **Inline Action Modals**: Confirmations for closing, unpublishing, duplicating, and deleting positions.

### 1.7 Multi-Tenancy & Authorization Security
- **Tenant Isolation**: Strict enforcement ensuring recruiters and employers can only view, create, edit, or delete vacancies belonging to their authorized `organization_id`.
- **Server/DB-Side Authorization**: RBAC matrix and database-level checks reject cross-tenant manipulation with HTTP 403 Forbidden errors.

## 4. AI-Ready Intelligence Layer Implementation

### 4.1 Server-Side Gemini Architecture & Abstraction Layer
- **`IAIProvider` Strategy Pattern**:
  - Provider abstraction interface (`src/services/ai/aiTypes.ts`) defining 5 core AI operations.
